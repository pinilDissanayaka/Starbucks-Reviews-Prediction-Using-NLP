Today I went in to buy one and noticed it was 1/2 the size as it usually is and went up in price $3.25.  I asked the kid at the counter and he said no, i don't think so?

After waiting 10 minutes in line behind 5 cars i thought hey i am not lazy i ll just park and go in.  I looked to my left and thought the parking lot was adjoining.  I then proceeded to high center my lexus on the curb.  i had to call a tow truck.  This was a dumb mistake on my part, however aftre talking with employees and it came to my attention it has happened many times.  while sitting there a person cannot see the high curb.  there are no poles or sign to help the consumer out, an easy fix.p>  I would have dropped the whole situation but i don';t want another patron to wreck their car, so i contacted the store manager.  I thought starbucks mission was to keep customers.  Not this manager, Todd Jefferson.  He basically told me there was nothing he could do, expressed no regret, acknowledged it has happened before, but  oh well go ***** ********. I thought perhaps he could reimburse me the 75 dollars for the tow truck or just offer a free cup of coffee, but no.  It is apparent this manager cares little about customers.\",\n",

A few weeks ago, I was told that Starbucks no longer brews dark-roast coffee after 12:00 -- a corporate wide decision.  The young woman behind the counter told me that Starbucks had decided coffee drinkers didn't need the extra boost of dark roast in the afternoon and that the Pike's Peak brew would be sufficient.  Since when did Starbucks decide they could dictate what roast I want or need in the afternoon.  Sorry, but I prefer dark roast and will now look to other coffeehouses to satisfy my afternoon fix. \",\n",

I bought two cups of coffee and stood in line to use the restroom. I waited for around 10 minutes. Few people went to the counter for the keys. But they never helped us open the bathroom. After a while a few European customers started complaining. The three girls at the counter started shouting, saying we don't like being disrespected. How ridiculous is that? Here are people waiting to use the bathroom for a long time and when they start to complain they feel disrespected.
